/*
 * STREAM TRANSDUCERS
 *
 * A stream transducer takes one or more streams as inputs, and
 * produces zero or more streams as output.  For simplicity, the only
 * transducer that produces more than one stream is built-in.  all
 * user-defined transducers produce just one stream.
 *
 * We can construct a transducer tree, which consists of a number of
 * _sources_ that produce streams, which are then modified by various
 * _transducers_, and finally connected to a single _sink_.
 *
 * Sources, sinks, and transducers are produced by providing a
 * source-, sink-, and transduction-function, respectively.  Whenever
 * we create a transducer or a source, a new stream is returned on
 * which we can read the result.  This stream can then be passed to
 * another transducer, or to a sink.
 *
 * Each stream may be used as input to only one transducer, but a
 * special built-in transducer exists that duplicates a stream.
 *
